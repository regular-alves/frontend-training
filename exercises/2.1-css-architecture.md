# 2.1 CSS Architecture

## Goals
- Zero `!important` declarations
- CSS organized with `@layer`
- Container queries for reusable components

---

## Errors to Find

| # | Error | Difficulty |
|---|-------|------------|
| 2.1.1 | Multiple `!important` declarations | Medium |
| 2.1.2 | CSS without `@layer` organization | Hard |
| 2.1.3 | Only media queries instead of container queries | Hard |

---

## What to Look For

```css
/* !important abuse */
color: red !important;

/* Missing layer structure */
@layer base, components, utilities;

/* Viewport-only responsive */
@media (max-width: 768px) { }
/* Should also have: */
@container (max-width: 400px) { }
```

---

## Validation

1. Search for `!important` in CSS
2. Verify `@layer` declarations exist
3. Check if speaker grid uses container queries
